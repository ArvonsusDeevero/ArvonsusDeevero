## Hi, I'm Deever 👋
**📌About** <br>
Hi, I'm Arvonsus Deevero Ligouri, usually called Deever. Hello! I’m a Game Developer specializing in creating interactive experiences using Unity Engine. I’m deeply passionate about building engaging, immersive, and creative games that bring ideas to life.

I work primarily with C#, and I have experience in gameplay programming, physics simulation, AI behavior, and game UI/UX design.

I believe that every game has the power to tell a story and evoke emotions in players. That’s why I always strive to combine technology, design, and creativity to craft games that are not only fun to play but also meaningful.
